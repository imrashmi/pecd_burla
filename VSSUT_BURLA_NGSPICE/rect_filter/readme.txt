SIMULATION EXAMPLES AND EXERCISES
(L.Umanand, DESE, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore)

This folder contains
1. readme.txt - this file
2. rect_example folder - this contains files related to the simulation walk through that was discussed with respect to rectifier C-filter.
3. rect_01 folder - this contains schematic with inductive non-idealities included
4. rect_02 folder - this contains schematic which includes 2 resistors in the bridge to artificially distort the diode characteristics so that all diode do not appear as identical which is the case in reality.
5. rect_filter.m file - this the octave .m file that contains the rectifier C-filter design example. 

PRACTICE TASKS
1. Simulate the circuits given.
2. Observe the output voltage, input current, capacitor current and load current waveforms
3. Change the values of C and observe the effect.
4. Observe the effect of non-idealities on the currents and voltages.
5. Modify the circuit slightly by including one more diode bridge arm and apply 3 phase source. Observe the output voltage ripple and other currents and voltages.
6. Use the rect_filter.m design file as a template and try out for different power levels.
